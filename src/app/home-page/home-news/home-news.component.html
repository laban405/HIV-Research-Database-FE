      <li>Since the outbreak of the HIV and AIDS epidemic in Uganda in the early 1980s, Ugandan researchers have carried out 
        a lot of groundbreaking research.   Uganda’s national HIV and AIDS response greatly benefited from these efforts both 
        at local and global levels. It has enabled Uganda to manage the epidemic through generation of data, sharing of information and knowledge, 
        informed policies and shaped HIV programing.
